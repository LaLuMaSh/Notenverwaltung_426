## Project Vision Board

### VISION

#### What is your purpose for creating the product?
- Grade-Management-Tool for better overview
- Teachers do not publish the students grade with it's weight consistently. Also the current tool [ecolm] doesn't display the marks after one school period is over

#### Which positive change should it bring about?
- Students should be able to manage their marks on their own and be able to see their grades and averages over multiple years
- This makes them able to compare their performance over multiple periods
-  They can see good and bad trends and react appropriate


### TARGET GROUP

#### Which market or market segment does the product address? 
- Our product targets the educational segment
- We want to adress people in every class
- Every student who gets grades can manage them

#### Who are the target customers and users?
- The most obvious targets for this product are students
- It also could be used for companies if they are rating the work of their employees on regular basis


### NEEDS

- Having an overview over multiple periods or years
- Recognizing problems or bad trends early and allow appropriate reactions


### Product

#### What product is it?
- Still a grade management tool

#### What makes it stand out?
- You can decide which subjects you want to manage
- Marks can have different custom-weights
- The most outstanding thing is, that the students can save their grades on their own, have an average over all subjects and also all time periods

#### Is it feasible to develop the product?
- Probably not, but in future there will be better technology so that people can share one tool on multiple users and devices which nowadays is totally impossible
